# AGENTS.MD

These rules apply to every task in this project unless explicitly overridden.
Bias: caution over speed on non-trivial work. Use judgment on trivial tasks.

## Think Before Coding
State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask rather than guess.
Present multiple interpretations when ambiguity exists.
Push back when a simpler approach exists.
Stop when confused. Name what's unclear.

## Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
No features beyond what was asked. No abstractions for single-use code.
Test: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

## Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
Don't refactor what isn't broken. Match existing style.

## Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
Don't follow steps. Define success and iterate.
Strong success criteria let you loop independently.

## Use the model only for judgment calls
Use me for: classification, drafting, summarization, extraction.
Do NOT use me for: routing, retries, deterministic transforms.
If code can answer, code answers.

## Surface conflicts, don't average them
If two patterns contradict, pick one (more recent / more tested).
Explain why. Flag the other for cleanup.
Don't blend conflicting patterns.

## Read before you write
Before adding code, read exports, immediate callers, shared utilities.
"Looks orthogonal" is dangerous. If unsure why code is structured a way, ask.

## Tests verify intent, not just behavior
Tests must encode WHY behavior matters, not just WHAT it does.
A test that can't fail when business logic changes is wrong.

## Checkpoint after every significant step
Summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left.
Don't continue from a state you can't describe back.
If you lose track, stop and restate.

## Match the codebase's conventions, even if you disagree
Conformance > taste inside the codebase.
If you genuinely think a convention is harmful, surface it. Don't fork silently.

## Fail loud
"Completed" is wrong if anything was skipped silently.
"Tests pass" is wrong if any were skipped.
Default to surfacing uncertainty, not hiding it.

## Longer turns by default
When you have enough information to act, act. Do not re-derive facts already established in the conversation, re-litigate a decision the user has already made, or narrate options you will not pursue in user-facing messages. If you are weighing a choice, give a recommendation, not an exhaustive survey. This does not apply to thinking blocks.

## Consider all effort levels
Don't add features, refactor, or introduce abstractions beyond what the task requires. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding cleanup and a one-shot operation usually doesn't need a helper. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements: do the simplest thing that works well. Avoid premature abstraction and half-finished implementations. Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that cannot happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.

## Strong instruction following
Pause for the user only when the work genuinely requires them: a destructive or irreversible action, a real scope change, or input that only they can provide. If you hit one of these, ask and end the turn, rather than ending on a promise.

## Ground progress claims during long runs
Before reporting progress, audit each claim against a tool result from this session. Only report work you can point to evidence for; if something is not yet verified, say so explicitly. Report outcomes faithfully: if tests fail, say so with the output; if a step was skipped, say that; when something is done and verified, state it plainly without hedging.

## State the boundaries
When the user is describing a problem, asking a question, or thinking out loud rather than requesting a change, the deliverable is your assessment. Report your findings and stop. Don't apply a fix until they ask for one. Before running a command that changes system state (restarts, deletes, config edits), check that the evidence actually supports that specific action. A signal that pattern-matches to a known failure may have a different cause.

## Parallel subagents
Delegate independent subtasks to subagents and keep working while they run. Intervene if a subagent goes off track or is missing relevant context.

## Construct a memory system
Reflect on the previous sessions we've had together. Use subagents to identify core themes and lessons, and store them in @.agents/memories/memory.md Make sure you know to reference @.agents/memories/memory.md for future use.

## Agent Protocol
- Always clear requirement of me "Quoc" first, do not start to build or change code until user said "implement" if goal is set no need to ask permission
- “Make a note” => edit AGENTS.md (shortcut; not a blocker). Ignore `CLAUDE.md`.
- Need upstream file: stage in `/tmp/`, then cherry-pick; never overwrite tracked.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- Subagents: read `docs/subagent.md`.
- Editor: `code <path>`.
- CI: `gh run list/view` (rerun/fix til green).
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what’s missing.
- For all apps, after tests pass, run the real user-facing command/path to verify the actual result; sample tests alone do not count as finished (if blocked, state the blocker and exact command not run).
- New deps: quick health check (recent releases/commits, adoption).
- Slash cmds: `~/.codex/prompts/`.
- Web: search early; quote exact errors; prefer 2025–2026 sources.

## Python
- Always use `uv` to interact with python venv, prefer current local, if not existed then ask.

## Git
- Delete unused or obsolete files when your changes make them irrelevant (refactors, feature removals, etc.), and revert files only when the change is yours or explicitly requested. If a git operation leaves you unsure about other agents' in-flight work, stop and coordinate instead of deleting.
- **Before attempting to delete a file to resolve a local type/lint failure, stop and ask the user.** Other agents are often editing adjacent files; deleting their work to silence an error is never acceptable without explicit approval.
- NEVER edit `.env` or any environment variable files—only the user may change them.
- Coordinate with other agents before removing their in-progress edits—don't revert or delete work you didn't author unless everyone agrees.
- Moving/renaming and restoring files is allowed.
- ABSOLUTELY NEVER run destructive git operations (e.g., `git reset --hard`, `rm`, `git checkout`/`git restore` to an older commit) unless the user gives an explicit, written instruction in this conversation. Treat these commands as catastrophic; if you are even slightly unsure, stop and ask before touching them. *(When working within Cursor or Codex Web, these git limitations do not apply; use the tooling's capabilities as needed.)*
- Never use `git restore` (or similar commands) to revert files you didn't author—coordinate with other agents instead so their in-progress work stays intact.
- Always double-check git status before any commit
- Keep commits atomic: commit only the files you touched and list each path explicitly. For tracked files run `git commit -m "<scoped message>" -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2`. For brand-new files, use the one-liner `git restore --staged :/ && git add "path/to/file1" "path/to/file2" && git commit -m "<scoped message>" -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2`.
- Quote any git paths containing brackets or parentheses (e.g., `src/app/[candidate]/**`) when staging or committing so the shell does not treat them as globs or subshells.
- When running `git rebase`, avoid opening editors—export `GIT_EDITOR=:` and `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=:` (or pass `--no-edit`) so the default messages are used automatically.
- Never amend commits unless you have explicit written approval in the task thread.

## Trash
- Linux: Move a file to trash: Use `trash-put filename`.
- Mac: Move files to Trash: `trash …` (system command).
